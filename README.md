# BBQ Thermometer

A BBQ Thermometer based on an thermometer probe from an old stove.
I found this thermometer probe and after some research I a determined that it is a NTC thermistor and also I found the datasheet.

I used a arduino nano,a 7segment display and some resistors.
In the future(when I receive some parts) I will build an enclosure and I will make it battery powered with 18650.
